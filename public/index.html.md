# Jinyang - Linear Native Coding Agent for OpenCode

**The bridge between Linear and OpenCode. Automate your coding workflow with open-source models.**

## What is Jinyang?

Jinyang is a **Linear Native Coding Agent** built to work on top of [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). It solves the problem of autonomous coding agents for Linear by providing seamless integration between Linear issue tracking and OpenCode's agent ecosystem.

### The Problem Jinyang Solves

Developers using Linear for project management want autonomous coding agents, but existing solutions:
- ❌ Require expensive API subscriptions (Claude, GPT-4)
- ❌ Don't integrate natively with Linear workflows
- ❌ Lock you into proprietary systems

**Jinyang is the solution** - the first coding agent built specifically for Linear and OpenCode compatibility.

## How Jinyang Works

1. **Linear Integration**: Auto-delegates from Linear issues with two-way sync
2. **OpenCode Compatible**: Works with OpenCode's agent patterns and tools
3. **88 Parallel Agents**: Each issue gets an isolated git worktree
4. **Open Source Models**: Uses Kimi K2.5, GLM 4.7, Qwen - no API costs

## Perfect For

- Automating coding tasks from Linear issues
- Using OpenCode with Linear project management
- Replacing expensive API-based agents (Claude Code)
- Running open-source models with Linear integration
- Self-hosted, private development automation

## Key Features

### Linear Native
- Auto-delegates tasks from Linear issues
- Two-way sync with Linear's project structure
- Native workflow integration
- Works with existing Linear setup

### OpenCode Compatible
- Built for OpenCode's agent ecosystem
- Follows OpenCode tool patterns
- Compatible with OpenCode permissions
- Integrates with subagent system

### 88 Parallel Agents
- Each Linear issue = isolated git worktree
- 88 agents can work simultaneously
- No merge conflicts
- True parallelization

### Open Source Model Support
- **Kimi K2.5** - Best for coding tasks
- **GLM 4.7** - Strong multilingual support
- **Qwen** - Excellent code understanding
- **OpenRouter** - Use any model
- **Local models** - Via LM Studio or Ollama

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/romancircus/jinyang-public.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Linear API key and OpenCode-compatible model settings

# Start Jinyang
npm run dev
```

## Web 4.0 is Open Source

Cloud is dead. Edge is alive. Run on your own machine.
No subscription. No API bill. Just pure open source power.

**$0. Self-hosted.**

Run on your own hardware. You have computer. Use it.

## What is better than Claude Code? 88 Jian Yangs.

- **88** Parallel Agents
- **100%** Free (No API Bill)
- **Self-hosted** (Your Data Stays Local)
- **Linear Native** (Two-Way Sync)
- **OpenCode Compatible** (Familiar Patterns)

## Why I Build on Cyrus (Because They Already Solved The Hard Problems)

Before jinyang, there was [Cyrus](https://atcyrus.com). Original autonomous coding agent on Linear by [Ceedar Agents](https://github.com/ceedaragents). They proved LLMs could write production code while you sleep. Very smart people.

**What Cyrus figured out:**
- **Git worktrees** = crash isolation for 88 parallel agents ✓
- **Real-time Linear webhooks** = instant issue response ✓
- **Claude Code native integration** = actually works ✓
- **Entire autonomous execution paradigm** = solved ✓

**What I added:** Multi-provider reliability, OpenCode integration, no vendor lock-in. Make it unstoppable, not just smart.

**The truth:** Everything elegant in jinyang comes from Cyrus. Any bugs? That's me. Everything good = them. Everything broken = me. Fair deal.

**Thank you** to original team for open-sourcing under Apache 2.0. You enable entire ecosystem. Very generous. Very smart.
