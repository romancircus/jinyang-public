It spawns 88 parallel agents via git worktrees to handle software development tasks without API costs, using open-source models like Kimi K2.5, GLM 4.7, and Qwen."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is Jinyang different from Claude Code?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Jinyang is the open-source alternative to Claude Code. While Claude Code uses proprietary Claude API and costs money, Jinyang uses free open-source models (Kimi, GLM, Qwen) and runs 88 parallel agents simultaneously via git worktrees. It is self-hosted, meaning your code never leaves your machine."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Jinyang free?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Jinyang is 100% free forever. No API bills, no subscriptions, no usage limits. You run it on your own hardware using open-source models."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What models does Jinyang support?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Jinyang supports Kimi K2.5, GLM 4.7, Qwen, and any OpenRouter-compatible models. You can also use local models via LM Studio or Ollama."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do the 88 parallel agents work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Jinyang creates isolated git worktrees for each Linear issue. Each worktree runs an independent agent that can work on its task without interfering with others. This allows true parallelization - 88 agents can work on 88 different issues simultaneously."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is my code safe with Jinyang?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Jinyang is self-hosted. Your code stays on your machines, always. Unlike cloud-based solutions, nothing is sent to external APIs unless you explicitly configure it that way."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the system requirements?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You need Node.js 18+, Git with worktree support, a Linear API key, and access to an LLM (local via LM Studio/Ollama or remote via OpenRouter)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Jinyang require Linear?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Jinyang is built specifically for Linear integration. It auto-delegates from Linear issues and provides two-way sync. This is what makes it \"Linear Native\"."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use Claude with Jinyang?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Technically yes via OpenRouter, but that defeats the purpose. Jinyang is designed for open-source models that are free. Using Claude would incur API costs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is it called Jinyang?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Jinyang is the Chinese knock-off of Cyrus (the original Claude Code for Linear).
